# airpane-seating
Airplane seating algorithm solve in python
The problem statement is to allocate each passenger to a seat which is given as the input to the program based on the following constraints.
<li>
Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back, starting from the left to the right.
Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center seats (any order in center seats)
</li>
This is written using python3. To run the program run ``` python seating.py``` in the command prompt. This will return the desired output in the terminal.

Space Complexity shold be O(rows * Cloumn) or O(mn)
Linear seating or runtime complexity should be O(n) where n is number of passengers
